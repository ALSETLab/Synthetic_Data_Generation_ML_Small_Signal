## Abstract

This article presents a simulation-based massive data generation procedure with applications in training machine learning (ML) solutions to automatically assess the small-signal stability condition of a power system subjected to a contingency. This method of scenario generation for employs a Monte Carlo two-stage sampling procedure to set up a contingency condition while considering the likelihood of a given combination of line outages. The generated data is pre-processed and then used to train several ML models (logistic and softmax regression, support vector machines, $k$-nearest Neighbors, Na√Øve Bayes and decision trees), and a deep learning neural network. The performance of the ML algorithms shows the potential to be deployed in efficient real-time solutions to assist power system operators.
